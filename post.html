   When it comes to paying for college, everything starts with your school's
   <strong>cost of attendance</strong> — or COA. This number affects how much financial aid you're
   eligible to receive, including scholarships, grants, and both federal and private student
   loans.<br /><br /><strong>But what exactly is included in the cost of attendance?<br /></strong
   ><br />Cost of attendance is the school's estimate of
   <strong>how much it will cost to attend college for one academic year</strong>. It includes both
   direct costs (like tuition and fees) and indirect costs (like housing and personal expenses).<br /><br />Here's
   a breakdown of what's typically included:<br />* Tuition and required fees<br />· On-campus
   housing or estimated rent for off-campus housing<br />Meal plans or food costs<br />Books,
   supplies, and course materials<br />Technology needs like a laptop or printer<br />Transportation
   and travel costs<br />Miscellaneous personal expenses<br /><br />I t's important to note that the
   COA is determined by your school, and it may vary based on your major, housing status, or whether
   you're attending full-time or part-time. Your school uses this number to determine how much
   financial aid you're eligible for — and private lenders use it to limit the amount you can
   borrow.<br /><br />For example, if your cost of attendance is $30,000 and you've received $20,000
   in scholarships, grants, and federal aid, your financial aid gap is $10,000. That's the amount a
   private student loan can cover — and nothing more.<br /><br />At GradBridge, we work with your
   school to certify your loan amount based on your COA to ensure that borrowing stays within
   responsible limits and is used only for qualified education expenses.<br />Understanding your
   cost of attendance helps you plan better, avoid overborrowing, and ensure your loan is being used
   to support your path to graduation.
