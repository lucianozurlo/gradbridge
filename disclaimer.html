                  laws, rules and regulations (“Laws”). The Service is not available to any Users
                  previously removed from the Service (or whose User accounts have been terminated)
                  by GradBridge. You represent and warrant that you possess the legal right and
                  ability to enter into these Terms and to use the Service in accordance with these

                  information via the Service, you are making any and all certifications required by
                  applicable Laws and that such electronic certifications have the same force and
                  effect as a manually signed certification. You agree that parties whom you
                  authorize to print applications, forms, or other documents have the right to print
                  “signature on file” on the hard copy of such materials on which such certification
                  is required. If required by a government agency, or at our request, you agree to
                  provide written certification in hard copy form. (c) To install any products

                  and will continue to comply with all applicable Laws (including, without

               <p>
                  <strong>3. USER MATERIALS</strong><br />
                  You may submit content, information, User Data or other materials (together with
                  all intellectual property rights in and to such materials, “User Materials”) to
                  the Service in order to communicate with us (or our third-party customer service
                  provider) or submit forms or applications through the Service, including, without
                  limitation, for the hosting, sharing and display of such User Materials and to
                  apply for or request products or services. When applying for or requesting a
                  product or service or otherwise submitting User Materials on or through the
                  Website, you agree to provide current, complete, and accurate information about

                  (iii) contain any information or content that you do not have a right to make

                  terminate your application(s) for GradBridge products or services and/or to
                  decline to provide any future access to the Service. Use of the Service and the
                  submission of any User Materials completed by you or otherwise submitted through
                  the Service do not qualify you for or guarantee that you will receive any
                  requested GradBridge products or services. Your eligibility for GradBridge
                  products and services will be determined according to and consistent with the
                  terms, conditions, and other criteria applicable to the products and services in
                  question.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>4. GRADBRIDGE MATERIALS; LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES</strong><br />
                  4.1 GradBridge Materials. On the Service, you will find Content (as defined
                  below), functions, information, and tools, including some that are prepared,
                  provided, or maintained by third parties that are not the property of GradBridge
                  (collectively, “GradBridge Materials”). While we strive to keep the GradBridge
                  Materials current and accurate, we cannot guarantee, and therefore expressly do
                  not warrant, that the GradBridge Materials are current, accurate, or error-free,
                  or that your access will be uninterrupted or that material accessible from the
                  Service is free of viruses or other malicious code.<br />
                  4.2 Links to Third-Party Sites. On the Service, you will find numerous links which
                  will transfer you to the websites of third parties that can provide you with
                  potentially relevant information and/or functionality (each, a “Third Party
                  Site”). GradBridge is not responsible for the content and performance of these
                  sites or for your transactions with them. GradBridge makes no warranties, either
                  express or implied, concerning the content of any Third Party Site, including the
                  accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability thereof for any particular
                  purpose. GradBridge does not warrant that any Third Party Site is free from any
                  claims of copyright, trademark, or other infringement. GradBridge does not warrant
                  that any Third Party Site is free from any viruses or other contamination. You
                  understand that Third Party Sites may have a privacy policy that is different from
                  that of GradBridge and that Third Party Sites may provide less security than this
                  Website. The choice to access a Third Party Site, or to purchase or otherwise use
                  any of the products or services advertised or provided on a Third Party Site is
                  yours, in your sole discretion. Furthermore, while GradBridge strives to keep
                  these links as current and accurate as possible, we cannot guarantee, and
                  therefore we expressly do not warrant, that they point to the intended third-party
                  website. Links to and from the Service do not constitute a GradBridge endorsement.

                  information or materials presented to you through the Service (“Content”) is
                  protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents or other proprietary

                  derivative works or otherwise use the Content for public or commercial purposes
                  without our express authorization. Use of the Content other than as expressly

                  acceptance of your submission, GradBridge does not waive any rights to use similar
                  or related ideas previously known to GradBridge, or developed by its employees or
                  contractors, or obtained from sources other than you.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>6. CONFIDENTIALITY; YOUR SECURITY OBLIGATIONS</strong><br />
                  You will maintain confidentiality concerning any confidential or proprietary
                  information which you access through the Service and you will protect such
                  information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. You acknowledge and agree
                  that the Service is, and shall at all times remain, the sole and exclusive

                  you will not authorize or permit its contents to be disclosed or in any manner

                  our prior written approval. You will restrict unauthorized users from gaining
                  access to the Service. If you are not a registered user, you may receive a user
                  name and password upon completing the registration process. You are responsible
                  for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords and for any and all
                  activities that occur under your passwords or User accounts. You agree to
                  immediately notify GradBridge of any unauthorized use of your User account or any
                  other breach of security known to you. You will take feasible steps to prevent
                  transmission over the Service of any virus or other software routine designed or
                  likely to permit unauthorized access to the Service or to disable, erase or
                  otherwise harm any software, hardware or data accessible over the Service. The
                  confidentiality obligations of this Section will survive the termination of your

                  OF WARRANTY AND OTHER DISCLAIMERS IN THESE TERMS, IN NO EVENT SHALL GRADBRIDGE BE
                  LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,

                  GRADBRIDGE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING,
                  TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICE OR YOUR ACCOUNT OR
                  THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE

                  INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR
                  OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION
                  APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE,
                  STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF GRADBRIDGE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
                  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO
                  THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.
                  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR
                  EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO SOME OF THE
                  ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. FURTHER, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS

                  GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT (“GLBA”) AND TO THE EXTENT ANY PROVISION OF THESE TERMS ARE
                  FOUND TO BE PROHIBITED BY, INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE UNDER THE GLBA, THAT PROVISION
                  WILL BE ENFORCED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMISSIBLE AND THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF
                  THESE TERMS WILL REMAIN IN FORCE. IF THESE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS ARE HELD TO
                  BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY
                  APPLICABLE LAW, THE MAXIMUM COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF GRADBRIDGE, IF ANY, FOR LOSSES
                  OR DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED $500. IN NO EVENT SHALL GRADBRIDGE BE LIABLE TO YOU
                  FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT REFERRED TO ABOVE.

                  <strong>15. ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong><br />
                  This Arbitration Provision and Class Action Waiver (“the Arbitration Provision”)
                  does not apply to any product that constitutes “consumer credit” under the
                  Military Lending Act (or its implementing regulations) that you may obtain from or
                  through us if you are a covered borrower under the Military Lending Act at the
                  time you obtain such product.<br />
                  15.1. Agreement to Arbitrate. Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this
                  Arbitration Provision, GradBridge, and any bank or financial institution with
                  which GradBridge partners, together with their parent companies, wholly or
                  majority-owned subsidiaries, affiliates, commonly-owned companies, successors,
                  assigns, and any of these entities' employees, officers, directors, and agents and
                  their successors, assigns, affiliates, and service providers (collectively, the
                  “Transaction Parties”) and you may each elect to resolve any past, present, or
                  future dispute or claim (“Dispute”) arising from or relating in any way to (i) the
                  use of the Website, (ii) these Terms, (iii) any loan application or any loan,
                  refinancing, or other agreement relating to or made or obtained through the use of
                  the Website, or (iv) the relationship between you and any Transaction Party in
                  connection with any of the foregoing that cannot be resolved directly between you
                  and a Transaction Party, by binding arbitration under the Consumer Arbitration
                  Rules (“the Consumer Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”),
                  rather than in court. (Solely for purposes of this Arbitration Provision, the term
                  Transaction Parties also includes any third party providing any goods and/or
                  services in connection with the use of the Website or any of the foregoing on
                  behalf of a Transaction Party, if that third party is named as a defendant along
                  with a Transaction Party in the same proceeding or a related proceeding.)<br />
                  15.2. Exceptions to “Dispute”. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing: (i) disputes
                  or controversies about the validity, enforceability, coverage, or scope of this
                  Arbitration Provision or any part thereof are for a court and not an arbitrator to
                  decide; however, disputes or controversies about these Terms or your agreements
                  governing the use of the Website or with Transaction Parties as a whole are for an
                  arbitrator and not a court to decide; (ii) any Disputes seeking to enforce or
                  protect, or concerning the validity of intellectual property rights, will not be
                  subject to binding arbitration under this Arbitration Provision; and (iii) any
                  party may proceed with their individual claims in small claims court (or an
                  equivalent court) if that option is available in the applicable jurisdiction and
                  the amount in controversy falls within the small claims court's (or the equivalent
                  court's) jurisdictional limits; but if that action is transferred, removed, or
                  appealed to a different court, arbitration can be elected. Moreover, this
                  Arbitration Provision will not apply to any Dispute that was already pending in
                  court before this Arbitration Provision took effect.<br />
                  15.3. Governing Law. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq., and
                  federal arbitration law apply to this Arbitration Provision. Any judgment on the
                  award rendered by the arbitrator will be final, subject to any appeal rights under
                  the FAA, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration
                  award involving the parties will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims
                  in any dispute involving anyone who is not a party to the arbitration, nor will an
                  arbitration award in prior disputes involving other parties have preclusive effect
                  in an arbitration between the parties to this Arbitration Provision. JURY TRIAL
                  WAIVER. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT YOUR CONSENT TO ARBITRATION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE
                  RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY.<br />
                  15.4. Arbitration Procedures. Either you or a Transaction Party can initiate
                  arbitration through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or by filing a
                  motion to compel arbitration of claims filed in court. Regardless of who elected
                  arbitration or how arbitration was elected, the party asserting the claim (i.e.,
                  the party seeking money damages or other relief from a court or an arbitrator) is
                  responsible for starting the arbitration proceeding. If the AAA cannot serve and
                  we cannot agree on a substitute, a court with jurisdiction shall select the
                  arbitrator, who will apply the AAA rules and the procedures specified in this
                  Arbitration Provision. Any arbitrator must be a practicing attorney with ten or
                  more years of experience practicing law or a retired judge. Any arbitration will
                  be governed by the then-current Consumer Rules, and its Procedures for the
                  Resolution of Disputes through Document Submission (“Document Submission
                  Procedures”). For more information about the AAA and its rules, you may contact
                  the AAA at 120 Broadway, Floor 21, New York, N.Y. 10271, 1-800-778-7879,
                  www.adr.org. Each party will bear the expense of its own attorneys, experts and
                  witnesses, regardless of which party prevails, unless applicable law, these Terms
                  or an applicable agreement gives a party the right to recover such expenses from
                  the other party. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator solely
                  based on written submissions and will not require any personal appearance by the
                  parties or witnesses unless the arbitrator determines that a telephonic or
                  in-person conference or hearing is necessary based on the request of one or more
                  of the parties. If an in-person hearing is necessary, it will be held in the
                  federal judicial district in which you reside or at another location that is
                  reasonably convenient to all parties. <br />
                  15.5. CLASS ACTION WAIVER. You and the Transaction Parties each agree that if
                  arbitration of a Dispute is elected, the Dispute will be resolved in arbitration
                  (not in court) only on an individual basis and not as a class, collective or other
                  representative action. To the fullest extent permitted under the FAA: (a) no
                  arbitration will be joined or consolidated with any other unless all parties
                  otherwise agree in writing; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to
                  be arbitrated on a class-action, collective action or private attorney general
                  basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or
                  authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on
                  behalf of the general public or any other persons. No arbitrator shall have the
                  authority to issue any relief that applies to any person or entity other than
                  Transaction Parties and/or you individually.<br />
                  15.6. Conflicts. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is inconsistent with
                  the Consumer Rules, with these Terms, or your agreements governing the use of this
                  Website, or with an arbitration provision in any agreement with a Transaction
                  Party (including, without limitation, any loan agreement), this Arbitration
                  Provision shall govern. <br />
                  15.7. Survival; Severance. This Arbitration Provision shall survive termination of
                  the Website or these Terms or of any agreement into which you enter with a
                  Transaction Party; and, further, you understand and agree that this Arbitration
                  Provision applies not only to these Terms but also to any subsequent agreement
                  (including without limitation any agreement governing the use of the Website or
                  any loan agreement) into which you enter with a Transaction Party. This
                  Arbitration Provision stays in force even if you withdraw your loan application or
                  your application is denied, if any loan obtained by you is repaid in full, if any
                  loan agreement or account is terminated or expires, or in the event of any
                  bankruptcy (if permitted by bankruptcy law). If any portion of this Arbitration
                  Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the
                  remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision, except that: (a) if the Class
                  Action Waiver is limited, voided or found unenforceable with respect to a Dispute
                  and that determination becomes final after all appeals have been exhausted, then
                  this Arbitration Provision (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with
                  respect to such proceeding. The parties acknowledge and agree that under no
                  circumstances will a class action be arbitrated; and (b) if a claim is brought
                  seeking public injunctive relief and a court determines that the restrictions in
                  the Class Action Waiver or elsewhere in this Arbitration Provision prohibiting the
                  arbitrator from awarding relief on behalf of third parties are unenforceable with
                  respect to such claim and that determination becomes final after all appeals have
                  been exhausted, the claim for public injunctive relief will be determined in court
                  and any individual claims seeking monetary relief will be arbitrated. In such a
                  case the parties will request that the court stay the claim for public injunctive
                  relief until the arbitration award pertaining to individual relief has been
                  entered in court. In no event will a claim for public injunctive relief be
                  arbitrated. <br />
                  15.8. RIGHT TO OPT OUT: If you do not want this Arbitration Provision to apply,
                  you must send us a signed notice within 30 calendar days of the date on which you
                  electronically submit an application for a product or service offered by a
                  Transaction Party through this site. You must send the notice in writing (and not
                  electronically) to GradBridge, 800 North King Street, Suite 304 #3596, Wilmington,
                  Delaware 19801, Attn: Arbitration Opt Out Notice. You must provide your name,
                  address, telephone number, loan or account number, if applicable, and state that
                  you “opt out” of the Arbitration Provision. Opting out will not affect the other
                  provisions of these Terms or any other agreement governing the Website or with a
                  Transaction Party. If you do not opt out, you will be bound by this Arbitration
                  Provision in these Terms and any other agreement governing a Service or with a
                  Transaction Party. Please note that if you enter an agreement with a Transaction
                  Party that contains a different arbitration provision with a right to opt out,
                  opting out of this Arbitration Provision is not a rejection of the arbitration
                  provision in the other agreement. You will need to separately opt out of the
                  arbitration provision in the other agreement if you do not want it to apply.
                  <br />
                  15.9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction You agree that your use of the Website and
                  these Terms (excluding the Arbitration Provision) shall be governed by all
                  applicable Federal laws and the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
                  effect to any principles of conflict of law. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds
                  in court rather than in arbitration, you agree to submit to the sole and exclusive
                  jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware. If
                  for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and the
                  Transaction Parties each waive any right to a jury trial.

                  <strong>16. GENERAL</strong><br />
                  16.1. Changes to These Terms. GradBridge may, in its sole discretion, modify or
                  update these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page
                  periodically. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the
                  'last modified' date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service
                  after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not
                  agree to any of these terms or any future Terms, do not use or access (or continue
                  to access) the Service. <br />
                  16.2. Limitations on Claims and Actions. You agree that regardless of any statute
                  or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to
                  use of the Service or the Terms must be filed by you within one (1) year after
                  such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.<br />
                  16.3. Force Majeure. In no event shall we be liable for damages caused by third
                  parties not under our control or by other causes beyond our reasonable control,
                  including, without limitation, damages caused by third party telecommunications
                  service providers.<br />
                  16.4. Construction; Interpretation. The section titles in these Terms are for
                  convenience only and have no legal effect.<br />
                  16.5. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for the indemnified parties set forth
                  in Section 10 above, the provisions of these Terms apply for the benefit of
                  GradBridge only. GradBridge has the right to assert and enforce those provisions
                  directly against you on its own behalf.<br />
                  16.6. International Visitors. The Service is controlled and operated from our
                  facilities in the United States. GradBridge makes no representations that the
                  Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. You may not use
                  the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or
                  are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.
                  Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely
                  directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the U.S. By using
                  the Service, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and
                  processed in the United States. 16.7. Miscellaneous. The failure of GradBridge to
                  exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a
                  waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a
                  court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that
                  the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected
                  in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and
                  effect. GradBridge expressly reserves the right to assign and transfer these
                  Terms, and its rights and obligations under these Terms, in part or as a whole,
                  without restriction, including, without limitation, to another legal entity as
                  part of any sale or merger of all or part of the GradBridge or its affiliates with
                  a separate legal entity. You may not transfer these Terms, or your rights or
                  obligations under these Terms, to any person or entity without our prior written
                  approval. These Terms, together with all agreements incorporated by reference, any
                  and all amendments and any and all additional written agreements you may enter
                  into with GradBridge in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire
                  agreement between you and GradBridge concerning the Service and supersedes all
                  prior agreements between the parties regarding the subject matter contained
                  herein.
